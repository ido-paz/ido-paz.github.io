        <h1>What is Backend Development?</h1>
        <p>
          Backend development, also known as server-side web development,
          involves creating the underlying infrastructure that powers the
          functionality of websites and applications. This includes tasks such
          as server configuration, database design, and API creation.

        <h2>Languages and Frameworks</h2>
        <p>
          There are many languages and frameworks that can be used for backend
          development, some of the most popular include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>C# / F# / VB# : .NET and ASP.NET</li>
          <li>JavaScript: Node.js and Express</li>
          <li>Python: Django and Flask</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 id="database">Database Management</h2>
        <p>
          Backend developers also work with databases to store and retrieve data
          for their applications. Some popular database management systems
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>SQL - MSSQL , MySQL</li>
          <li>NoSQL - MongoDB</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>API Development</h2>
        <p>
          Backend developers often create APIs (Application Programming
          Interfaces) to allow different systems and applications to communicate
          with each other. RESTful API design is a popular method for creating
          web-based APIs that follow a set of guidelines for creating URLs and
          handling requests and responses.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Backend development is a crucial aspect of web development that allows
          for the creation of efficient and scalable web applications.
          Understanding the languages, frameworks, and technologies used in
          backend development can help developers create powerful and robust
          server-side functionality.
